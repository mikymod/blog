* Verbs are a kind of rule; they’re the most important rules of a game. By a “verb,” I’m referring to any rule that gives the player liberty to act within the rules of the game. Any rule that lets the player change the game state. Any rule that lets the player do something. Verbs are the rules that allow the player to interact with the other rules in the game: “jump,” “shoot,” “fall,” or “flap” in the case of Joust. Without verbs we have a simulation, not a collaborative story-telling system.

* But we can’t design the player or her behavior. We design the rules that shape her experience, her choices, her performance. Rules are how we communicate. Verbs are the rules that allow her to communicate back. The game is a dialogue between game and player, and the rules we design are the vocabulary with which this conversation takes place.

* By establishing relationships between verbs, we give ourselves more opportunities to design choices.

* What we as creators want to avoid are orphaned verbs. An orphaned verb has no relationship to the other verbs, so the other verbs don’t reinforce it, it doesn’t grow, and the player has forgotten about it by the time she reaches the one situation that demands it.
* Give the important verbs in the game as much to do as possible, so you won’t be forced to fill the void with a bunch of secondary verbs that never get developed.

* Every interaction that the player could reasonably expect to have an effect should have one, even if it’s negative—that’s what I mean by a robust verb.
* As creators, we want to teach and reinforce rules wherever and whenever we have the opportunity.

* The ability to withhold information from the player, and to give her the liberty to discover rules and complexities of those rules on her own, makes the design of digital games so interesting.
